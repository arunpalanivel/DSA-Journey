## 📘 Overview

This repository is part of my **Prime Arun 2.0** challenge — a 60-day journey to strengthen my **Problem Solving, DSA, and Java** fundamentals while preparing for **internship interviews**.

Each problem solved here is organized under structured folders (Steps) as per **Striver’s A2Z Sheet**.

## 🧩 Repository Structure

| Folder | Topic |
|--------|--------|
| Step1_Basics_Patterns | Basic syntax, I/O, and pattern problems |
| Step2_Sorting | Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick sort |
| Step3_Arrays | Array basics, operations, subarray problems |
| Step4_BinarySearch | Searching problems and boundaries |
| Step5_Strings | String manipulation and pattern matching |
| Step6_LinkedLists | Single, Double, and Circular linked lists |
| Step7_Recursion_Backtracking | Recursive algorithms and backtracking |
| Step8_BitManipulation | Bitwise operations and tricks |
| Step9_Stacks_Queues | Stack, Queue, and their applications |
| Step10_SlidingWindow | Sliding window and two-pointer techniques |
| Step11_Heaps | Priority Queues and Heap problems |
| Step12_BinaryTrees | Tree traversals and problems |

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

- Solve **2–3 problems daily** (mix of Easy & Medium).
- Maintain a **Mistake Log** for every bug or confusion.
- Focus on **patterns**, not memorization.
- Use version control effectively with meaningful commits.

Commit message example:
```bash
git commit -m "solve: Reverse array (A2Z Step 3 - Arrays)"
🏗️ Folder Example
Copy code
Step3_Arrays/
├── MaxMinElement.java
├── ReverseArray.java
└── SecondLargest.java
Each file should start with:
