## 📘 Overview

This repository is part of my **Prime Arun 2.0** challenge — a 60-day journey to strengthen my **Problem Solving, DSA, and Java** fundamentals while preparing for **internship interviews**.

Each problem solved here is organized under structured folders (Steps) as per [Striver’s A2Z Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-striver-a2z-dsa-sheet/).

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

- Solve **2–3 problems daily** (mix of Easy & Medium).
- Maintain a Mistake Log for every bug or confusion.
- Focus on patterns, not memorization.
- Use version control effectively with meaningful commits.

Commit message example:
```
git commit -m "solve: Reverse array (A2Z Step 3 - Arrays)"
```

Folder Example:
```
Step3_Arrays/
├── MaxMinElement.java
├── ReverseArray.java
└── SecondLargest.java
```

Each file should start with:
```
// Problem: Reverse Array
// Source: Striver A2Z Step 3
// Date: 2025-11-01
// Mistake Log: (if any)
```
